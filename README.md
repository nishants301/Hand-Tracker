# GameHandTracker

Hand Tracking in Real-Time using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**.

## Overview

This project demonstrates real-time hand tracking and landmark detection using MediaPipe. It captures video from your webcam, detects hands, and displays their key landmark positions live on screen. Example usage includes gesture recognition, touchless interfaces, or educational purposes.[3][4]

## Features

- **Real-time hand landmark detection** (with coordinates)
- Modular code: `HandTrackingMin.py` (hand detector class) & `GameHandTracker.py` (main runner)
- FPS overlay for performance monitoring
- Uses popular libraries: **OpenCV** & **MediaPipe**

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - mediapipe
  - opencv-python

### Installation

Install required packages via pip:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python
```

Clone this repository and make sure both `.py` files are in the same folder.

## Usage

Run the main script to start hand tracking:

```bash
python GameHandTracker.py
```

- The webcam feed opens; detected hand landmarks are printed in console and can be visualized.
- Press `q` to exit.
